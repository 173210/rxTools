rxTools is a collection of hacking tools for Nintendo 3DS/3DSXL/2DS, compatible with all the system versions until 9.2.

It runs through the public Web Browser (spider) exploit.

The project is open-source, and requests as long as bug-reporting are really appreciated, so that this toolkit can be
more complete as possible.
